            Founded in 1971 in Seattle’s Pike Place Market, Starbucks began as a
            humble coffee bean roaster and retailer. Over the decades, it has
            grown into the world’s leading coffeehouse chain, known for its
            rich, high-quality coffee and its warm, welcoming atmosphere.
            Starbucks revolutionized the coffee culture, offering customers more
            than just a cup of coffee—it became a place to relax, connect, and
            find community.
          </p>

            Starbucks’ mission is simple yet profound: to inspire and nurture
            the human spirit—one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a
            time. This vision guides their commitment to providing customers
            with exceptional coffee experiences while maintaining a strong focus
            on ethical sourcing, sustainability, and social responsibility.
            Starbucks works to create a positive impact, from supporting coffee
            farmers to reducing environmental footprints.

            What sets Starbucks apart is its dedication to not only great coffee
            but also creating a unique, inclusive space for everyone. Whether
            it’s their handcrafted beverages, their variety of food options, or
            the welcoming ambiance of their stores, Starbucks has cultivated an
            experience that is about more than just coffee. Through their global
            initiatives, they focus on community building, environmental
            stewardship, and empowering people through job opportunities and
            ethical sourcing practices. Starbucks isn’t just a coffee shop; it’s
            a place where connections are made, and communities thrive.
